# Cleanup git credentials

Cleanup cached git credentials before switching to new account.

## Description:

It's a bit obnoxious to switch between different git accounts while using both VS and VsCode and multiple git accounts.
To speed up the process need to clear specific credentials in Windows Credential Manager and set new user name and email in git global config.

## Usage:

In settings.json specify credential records to remove, list profiles to switch between and run CMD: GitCreds.exe
